# munin3
This is a KICAD version of the Munin 3 100W amplifer designed by Kjell - LA2NI. Note that some of the DNI parts have been left out of the schematic. Note
that the design has NOT been debugged yet, i.e. my version of the schematic is being assembled right now. I'll update this when I have verified that the
design works!
